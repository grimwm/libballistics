//To compile this example, run the following:

#include <stdio.h>

#include "angle.c"

	Ballistics* solution;

	double angle=0; // The shooting angle (uphill / downhill), in degrees.
	double zero=100; // The zero range of the rifle, in yards.
	double windspeed=0; // The wind speed in miles per hour.
	double windangle=0; // The wind angle (0=headwind, 90=right to left, 180=tailwind, 270/-90=left to right)

	// achieve a zero at a particular yardage.  This value isn't very useful
	// to us, but is required for making a full ballistic solution.
